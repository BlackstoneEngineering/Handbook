## Choose your environment
In the mbed ecosystem you have choice on how you want to develop, **Online** and **Offline**. 

1) Online there is the Mbed Compiler. This choice is great if you want an environment that 'just works'. All you need is a web browser and you're good to go. 

2) Offline there is Mbed CLI, a full suite of tools for use on the command line. Mbed CLI is compatible with Windows, Linux and OSX. This option provides more configuratino options but also requires slightly more setup. 

Common to any choice is the ability to import and publish code to Git and Mercurial repositories, export your programs to 3rd party IDE's (Keil UVision, IAR, GCC,...etc) for debug, and generally build awesome projects.
